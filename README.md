# rocm-rs: Safe Rust wrappers for AMD ROCm Libraries

This project provides Rust bindings for AMD's ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) libraries, allowing Rust developers to leverage AMD GPUs for high-performance computing.

## Current Status

**Note: This project is in early development.**

Currently implemented:
- ✅ rocFFT - Fast Fourier Transform library (raw bindings + safe wrappers)
- ✅ HIP - Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability (raw bindings + safe wrappers)
- ✅ rocBLAS - Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (raw bindings + safe wrappers)
- ✅ MIOpen - Deep learning primitives (raw bindings + safe wrappers)
- ✅ rocRAND - Random number generation (raw bindings + safe wrappers)
- ✅ rocSOLVER - Linear system solvers (raw bindings only)
- ✅ rocSPARSE - Sparse linear algebra (raw bindings only)
- ✅ rocmsmi - system managment interface (refer to [rocm_smi_lib](https://github.com/PTFOPlayer/rocm_smi_lib_rs))

The project currently focuses on providing raw FFI bindings for most libraries, with safe Rust wrappers available for rocFFT. Additional safe wrappers for other libraries are planned for future development.

## Prerequisites

- AMD ROCm installed (version 6.3 or later recommended.It may work on older versions, but I did not test that)
- Ubuntu 24.04 (it works on WSL too)
- Rust toolchain (1.65.0 or later recommended)
- A compatible AMD GPU

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rocm-rs = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

First, ensure that the ROCm libraries are in your library path or set the `ROCM_PATH` environment variable.

### Using rocFFT with safe wrappers:

```rust
use rocm_rs::rocfft::{self, plan, execution, field};

fn main() {
    // Initialize the rocFFT library
    // Use the safe wrappers for rocFFT
    let plan = plan::Plan::new(/* parameters */);
    let field = field::Field::new(/* parameters */);
    let execution = execution::Execution::new(/* parameters */);
    
    // Perform FFT operations
    // ...
}
```

### Using other libraries with raw bindings:

```rust
use rocm_rs::hip::*;

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        // Example of using HIP raw bindings
        let mut device_count = 0;
        hipGetDeviceCount(&mut device_count);
        println!("Found {} HIP devices", device_count);
        
        // Use other raw bindings as needed
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Building from Source

**Important**: When building from source, you need to run `cargo build` first to generate the bindings files before you can use the library or run tests.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/radudiaconu0/rocm-rs.git
cd rocm-rs

# Set the ROCm path if not in the default location
export ROCM_PATH=/opt/rocm

# Build the project (generates bindings)
cargo build
```

## Feature flags

- rocm_smi - enables bindings and wrappers for rocm_smi_lib

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

When contributing:
1. Run `cargo build` first to generate the bindings
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation as needed
